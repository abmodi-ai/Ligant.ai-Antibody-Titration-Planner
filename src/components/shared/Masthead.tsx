/**
 * The page's identity, and the way out of it.
 *
 * This tool is the first in the set with siblings to link, so it is the first
 * to render the tool-switcher pills the shared stylesheet has carried since
 * before there was a second tool. The current tool is a `span` rather than an
 * `a`: there is no link to the page you are already on, and the stylesheet
 * matches on the attribute rather than the element for exactly that reason.
 *
 * SIBLING LINKS ARE ABSOLUTE, not root-relative, and that is deliberate: this
 * page is reachable at more than one origin (the router's
 * benchtools.ligant.ai and the Pages project's own *.pages.dev), and a
 * root-relative `/molarity-converter/` resolves against whichever origin the
 * reader is actually on. From the router that is correct; from the raw Pages
 * origin it 404s, because that path does not exist on THIS tool's own
 * project. `absoluteUrl` pins every sibling link to the one address the
 * suite is actually served from, regardless of which origin this page was
 * reached through.
 *
 * C4-NF-05 requires this tool to be reachable and usable at its own address
 * independently of any other, including without C1 and C3. These links are a
 * convenience for a reader, not a dependency: nothing on this page loads from
 * them, and the tool works with every one of them broken.
 *
 * TWO MORE LINKS, one level up each: the Ligant lockup goes to `ligant.ai`,
 * the parent site, and "Bench Tools" goes to the suite's own root
 * (`absoluteUrl('/')`, not a bare `/`, for the same reason the sibling links
 * are absolute). Neither is a tool switch, so neither belongs in `.tool-nav`
 * or gets an `aria-current` treatment; they are a way out to the level above
 * this page, not a way sideways to a peer of it.
